# Exercise 05 — Ridge Regression

**Course:** Machine Learning Lab  
**Programme:** I M.Sc. Data Science · I Semester  
**Department Number:** 26-PDS-011

## 1. Aim
Implement Ridge Regression (L2 regularisation) on the housing dataset using fourth-degree polynomial features and compare it with ordinary linear regression.

## 2. Dataset
- **Expected path:** `Dataset/Housing.csv`
- Obtain the dataset from an authorised source. Do not commit data that cannot legally be redistributed.
- See the [dataset guide](../datasets/README.md).

## 3. Algorithm / Workflow
1. Load Housing.csv and create dummy variables for categorical columns.
2. Split predictors and price into train/test sets (80:20, random_state=42).
3. Standardise features.
4. Generate degree-4 polynomial features.
5. Fit ordinary LinearRegression and record train/test R².
6. Fit Ridge(alpha=100) and record train/test R².
7. Compare model scores and train/test gaps in a table and bar chart.

## 4. Implementation
- [Original Python program](./ex-05.py)
- [Jupyter notebook](./ex-05.ipynb)

The Python program is preserved as-is. The notebook splits its existing code into executable cells; it does not replace the original implementation.

## 5. Results
**Result summary transcribed from the supplied practical record:**

The record reports ordinary linear regression train R² 0.9940 and test R² −2874.77. Ridge(alpha=100) had train R² 0.9637 and test R² 0.2892, substantially reducing the train/test gap.

This is a recorded result, not a fresh run performed during this update. Run the notebook with the correct dataset and dependencies to generate current outputs and plots.

## 6. Interpretation and validation
Interpret outputs from your run and document limitations. Check for leakage, duplicates and evaluation design before interpreting unexpectedly high classification scores as generalisable.

## 7. Conclusion

Ridge Regression applies L2 regularisation to constrain coefficient magnitudes. The practical-record results indicate that regularisation greatly reduced the extreme train/test gap seen with ordinary linear regression, although the reported test R² remained modest; feature scaling and selection of alpha should be evaluated carefully.

## 8. Reproducibility

The GitHub Actions workflow uses Python 3.12. The notebook reads `datasets/Housing.csv` from this repository's `main` branch. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` without pinned versions. Record the repository commit or dataset checksum, `python --version`, and `python -m pip freeze`.
